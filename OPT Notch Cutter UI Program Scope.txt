Project Scope
-----------------------------------------------------

-- User Interface --

UI will have multiple NotchCutter Monitor panels and will be able to interface with multiple devices -- one for each panel.

Each NotchCutter Monitor panel will have
   
    1 red LED array to display Voltage level (10 LEDs)
    1 green LED array to display Current level (10 LEDs)
    1 value spinner for entry of target depth value
    1 button so send target depth value to associated device
    1 label showing current cutting head position
    1 green LED to show Power OK status
    1 red LED so show Power Shorted status
    1 radio button to select NotchWall mode
    1 button to turn cutting voltage on and off
    1 button to raise cutting head
    1 button to lower cutting head
    1 button to start cutting sequence
    1 button to startstop cycle test
    1 button to increase cutting aggression
    1 button to decrease cutting aggression
    1 button to save values and settings to disk

-- Program Operation --

On startup, program will broadcast UDP packets to all listeners on the ethernet port.
All listeners who respond will be stored in an array of devices.
A panel will be created for each device in the array.
A TCPIP connection will be made with each device.
Stored values will be loaded and sent to each device.
When user clicks a button, data andor values will be sent to the appropriate device.
The ethernet connections will be monitored for data from the devices.
The Voltage and Current LED arrays will be set according to values received from the devices.
The cutting head position label will be updated from values received from the devices.
When the user clicks the Save button, the current values and settings in that panel will be saved to disk.

-- Legacy Code --

Subroutines to broadcast UDP queries and create TCPIP links already exist and will be modified for this project.
Subroutines to save data in ini file format already exist and will be used in this project.
